Remove the fury currently on Belphagor. If there are any fury on Bethayne when she melds, place them on Belphagor. Belphegor cannot activate later in the turn in which it becomes flesh melded.\n\nWhile melded, Belphagor becomes a warlock warrior model, loses Soulless, takes Control of Bethayne's battlegroup, and can upkeep spells cast by Bethayne. While melded, Belphagor's base CMD becomes 9 and it's base ARC and AAT becomes 7. While melded, Belphagor can cast Bethayne's spells and use her feat. While melded, Belphagor is not considered to be a warbeast and loses it's animus. While melded, Belphagr can make slam and throw power attacks without being forced. While melded, Belphagor suffers damage like a warbeast but does not suffer the effects of crippled aspects. Effects modifying the amount of damage to or the manner in which damage is applied to a warbeast still apply to Belphagor, even while it is melded. If Belphagor is destroyed or removed from play while melded, Bethayne is destroyed.\n\nBethayne can separate from Belphagor during your Maintenance Phase.
